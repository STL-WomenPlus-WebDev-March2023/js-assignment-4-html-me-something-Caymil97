      <h3 id="funParagraph">My Dad:&nbsp;Samuel</h3>
      <img src="images/Dad.png" alt="Dad" height="400" width="auto">
      <p>
         <ul>Zodiac Sign: Scorpio</ul>
         <ul>Occupation: Self-Employed Engineer</ul>
         <ul>Hobbies & Interests: Cooking, Home Improvement, and Story-telling</ul>
      </p>
      <p>My dad, Samuel is incredibly hard-working, intelligent, and strong-willed.
         His hobbies of home improvement and cooking show how much the quality of life at home
         is important to him. My dad spent his early years in an island in Polillo, Philippines. Growing up
         with very little, school was very hard for him. Books, school uniforms, and lunches were
         usually out of reach which is why he strived to do well in school and eventually become an engineer.
         Fortunately, his hard work showed with the opportunity to move to the United States to fulfill
         his American Dream. Eventually, passing the dream onto his children, my Brother and I.

      <h3 id="funParagraph">My Mom:&nbsp;Lani</h3>
      <img src="images/Mom.jpg" alt="Mom and Camille" height="400" width="auto">
      <p>
         <ul>Zodiac Sign: Aries</ul>
         <ul>Occupation: Nurse</ul>
         <ul>Hobbies & Interests: Candy Crush, Shopping, and Singing</ul>
      </p>
      <p>My mother, Lani is hard-working, young-spirited, and gentle. I don't think I've ever seen
         my mom actually angry. She has a soft and gentle spirit but also young at heart. She loves travelling
         and exploring like me. I'd say she's more adventurous than me, especially at her age. I even saw her
         try longboarding without fear! My mom is also a great nurse, she's been at her same profession even 
         before I was born. I don't think she's ever thought of switching careers, even though I know how 
         hard nursing as a profession can be.

         <ul>Occupation: Engineer at Boeing</ul>
         <ul>Hobbies & Interests: Video Games, Sports Cars, and Boba Tea</ul>
      </p>
   <p>
      My Brother Clarusse is intelligent and curious. Ever since I was little, I remember
       my brother getting into different types of hobbies. From solving rubix cubes, dice-stacking,
      and now sports cars. He was always into the finer things in life and I just happen to use him as my
      google reviews when I need to buy something new. All of my computer parts came from him and he showed me 
      how to build my very own PC. Sometimes I think he should've been the software engineer! Even though,
      he absolutely loves his job right now as an Engineer for Boeing. Growing up, my brother became my 
      best friend and everyday I am proud to tell people that he's my brother.

      <h3 id="funParagraph">My Bestfriend:&nbsp;Grace</h3>
      <img src="images/Grace.JPG" alt="Grace with skippy" width="400" height="auto">
      <p id="funParagraph">
         <ul>Zodiac Sign: Aries</ul>
         <ul>Occupation: Nursing Student</ul>
         <ul>Hobbies & Interests: Animals, Coffee, and Video Games</ul>

      </p>
      <p>My bestfriend Grace is stylish, funky, and compassionate. Grace has a deep love for all things animals.
         One of her favorite animals is the highland cow. Currently, she lives with a bunny, a dog, and a cat.
         As a nursing student, not only is she compassionate about animals but people as well. She takes great
         care of those around her and just has a general concern that's unending. Grace and I met at 2016 and
         she also happens to be my Brother's girlfriend. I love having her around because we can talk forever
         and she has turned into family.

      <h3 id="funParagraph">My Boyfriend:&nbsp;Montana</h3>
      <img src="images/MontanaCamille.jpg" alt="Montana and Camille photo">
      <figcaption>Mirror photo with Montana in Hawaii</figcaption>
      <p id="funParagraph">
         <ul>Zodiac Sign: Virgo</ul>
         <ul>Occupation: Ground Operations Agent</ul>
         <ul>Hobbies & Interests: Watching Anime, Video Games, and Playing Board Games</ul>
      </p>
        <p>Montana is the most caring, funny, and strong-willed guy I know. He absolutely loves little cute items
         and trinkets. I would attribute that to his love of anime. While I worked with him I realized how 
         fast he learned new things. Montana is also very physically strong and I was quite impressed.
         Now, I'd like to share how we met.
         My boyfriend Montana and I have been dating for almost a year now. Him and I met when I worked
         at Southwest Airlines where we were hired into the same group. Furthermore, we bonded over complaining about
         work and playing video games. We found ourselves talking over the phone until 5 in the morning. Even
         my very first phone call with him I talked to him until 2 a.m.
         We started off as good friends and
         I realized I liked him more than a friend, thankfully, he felt the same way. Shortly after our trip to
         Hawaii as friends, we became a couple. The picture attached is of us as friends in Maui, Hawaii.

      <p id="funParagraph">
         <img src="images/Me.jpg" alt="Camille">
         <ul>Zodiac Sign: Cancer</ul>
         <ul>Occupation: Student</ul>

      <p>Hey its me, Camille! First, I'd like to share where I started. I'm originally from the island of
         the Philippines. Moving to the United States at an early age was a big change in my life. The culture, language, and 
         the food was different. I turned to music when I had anxiety being in a new country. I poured
         a lot of my time into learning the violin, singing, guitar, and piano. My family thought I had 
         a crazy musical talent, but it was all actually just to ease my anxiety and stress! Anyways, I
         also found a new love for computer video games. I love learning new strategies on online multiplayer
         games like Overwatch and Dead by Daylight. I'd like to attribute my inclination for video games with 
         joining LaunchCode as well. Hopefully, one day I'll get to work on video games or applications.
